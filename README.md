# Shaky Trading Desk

### A node.js application that allows you to setup your own virtual trading platform. 

This app is forked from [Quote-Stream](https://github.com/nodesocket/quote-stream). It pushes realtime stock quotes to client side, listens and handles realtime client side orders. Currently, three type of orders are supported: limit, stop and market. API calls are also supported (through web sockets). 

## Current Stage
Shaky Trading desk is shaky. This is my first node application, so it is expected to be buggy. 

## Next Step
I will continue to refine it, and add margin accounts into play. Then, I will write another leg of the app, an automated trading algorithum example to communicate with Shaky Trading Desk (possibly in R), to allow for some quick and free quant strategy testing.
